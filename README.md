Learn about the different patterns to incorporate human feedback in your AI agents. We will go through a hands on live coding session to build an interactive AI agent using assistant-ui, an open-source React component library for chat interfaces. 

* Understanding Human-in-the-Loop: An overview of why human feedback is essential in AI development and how it can be systematically incorporated, including Generative UI, approvals and more.
* Design Patterns: Learn about the right UX patterns for human input
* Building with assistant-ui: Step-by-step guidance on using assistant-ui to develop interactive agents.

Solving the Python-Javascript dilemma with Reflex--a modern OSS Python web framework
-
Reflex is an open-source (Apache 2.0 & 20k+ GitHub stars) framework empowering Python developers to build internal (data, AI, and web) apps faster - with no JavaScript required. Build both your frontend and backend in a single language, Python. (pip install reflex). In this workshop, we'll go over how to set up Reflex and start building a dashboard app.

Name: Daniel Svonava / Co-founder & CEO @ Superlinked
Bio: Daniel is a co-founder of Superlinked - an open-source vector compute framework for building Metadata-aware Vector Search across RAG, RecSys, Search & Analytics. Previously, Daniel was an ML Tech Lead at YouTube Ads. Are you in the market for a Vector DB? Our community compared 44 of them: vdbs.superlinked.com

—
Build e-commerce recommendations, search and analytics with vectors.
-
* Use your unstructured AND structured data to handle queries like “popular blue t-shirts around $50”, for building a real-time personalized shopping feed and other features useful for e-commerce businesses - with a few lines of python, running at scale in your own GCP account.

Name: Adam Chan / DevRel @ Weaviate
Bio: Adam is a tinkerer by nature and an educator at heart. He started out his career creating curriculum on various topics in technology and delivering them to universities, high schools, and libraries. He soon joined the industry as a software engineer at Apple working on developer tools. While building software was exciting, he thoroughly missed education and connecting audiences with new ideas and as a result found Developer Relations Engineer at Google working on Google's suite of Business Communications products. Today, Adam works closely with software engineers around the globe to build epic applications with large language models with vector databases like Weaviate.

-
Get Chunked! Join this multistep challenge presented by Adam at Weaviate that will take you from zero to hero on chunking strategies for retrieval powered applications that leverage large language models.

Name: Jose Menendez / SWE @ Groq 
Bio: Jose is a SWE at Groq with 20 years of experience in the industry as Founder, high-performance data applications, Human/Computer interactions, and serves as a startup advisor in Silicon Valley. He tried to use an LLM to write this blurb but it was awful. 

-
Low latency on LLMs allow for some fun agentic workflows!

Name: Sam Stowers / AI Engineer @  W&B's Weave
Bio: Sam Stowers is an AI Engineer working on W&B's Weave, a leading LLM observability & evaluation tool, that takes 3 lines of code to instrument a gen AI app. He's helped many startups launch LLM-driven products, reaching thousands of users, and is working to make the process easier & more accessible. Before joining Weights & Biases, Sam founded an insomnia treatment app startup called Dozy. He's based in San Francisco, in the heart of the AI scene.

Make Your GenAI App Production-Ready with Tracing & Evaluations
—
LLM demos are easy - making them reliable enough for production is hard. Weave (from Weights & Biases) helps with every stage of development and deployment, so you can iterate rapidly and build confidence in your application. 
All with one tool! We'll walk through implementing the above using a simple voice AI example project. You'll walk away with the skills to implement advanced AI observability tooling.

* Understand complex queries with tracing (3 lines of code!!)
* apidly identify cost & latency bottlenecks
* Implement evaluations to make LLM responses consistently good
* Test which LLMs are best for your needs. 


Name: Luke Hollis
Bio: Luke is a 2x founder specializing in 3D graphics, building generative environments for training datasets and educational simulations that feature 3D captures. Previously, Luke was a visiting researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Generating Interactive Environments for Synthetic Training Data with Google Cloud and Diffusion World Models
—
Inspired by "Genie: Generative Interactive Environments" (Bruce et al., 2024), this hands-on workshop introduces you to generating interactive environments to build simulations or synthetic training data using diffusion world models. We'll demonstrate the basics of how world models can create and control interactive scenes, starting with simple Atari games. You'll learn the fundamental concepts behind generating synthetic training data while getting practical experience with video encoders. Building on real examples from robotic manipulation tasks, you'll learn how this method can provide diverse training data without requiring expensive real-world data collection, even generating physically plausible interactions with deformable objects. Based on Alonso et al., 2024, Bruce et al., 2024, Hafner et al., 2024, and other recent research. You'll leave with a working Colab that you can build on for your own projects.

Conversational AI has empowered the Chatbot application in recent years, making the Conversational User Interface (CUI) increasingly valuable. WhatsApp & WeChat are two of the largest world IM platforms. What if we could turn our personal accounts into a chatbot? It will be precious for many use cases if we can turn our account into a chatbot as a practical and convenient CUI application to serve users. In this workshop, you will learn how to use LLM to assistant you to convert your requirement in natural language to source code using Wechaty SDK.

* Learn what Wechaty SDK can do
* Design your requirement for automating your WhatsApp personal account
* Generate source code by prompting your requirement in natural language to LLM

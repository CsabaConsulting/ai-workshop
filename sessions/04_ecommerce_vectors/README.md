# Make E-commerce Vector-powered

Hi everybody,

In this session I'll introduce you to [Superlinked](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked) - a framework for building vector-powered systems!

We will build Search, Recommendations and Analytics on top of a multi-modal e-commerce dataset.

<ins>**THE CATCH:**</ins>
In most demos like this, people just use product images and descriptions.. while in reality you have to deal with product ratings, prices, behavioral data and more. Today, we will fix that!

## Session Overview

**Instructor:** [Daniel Svonava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svonava/), Founder at Superlinked, ex-ML TL in YouTube Ads

**Duration:** 30 minutes (1:30PM - Track 2)

**Objectives:**  
- Learn how to recognize problems solvable with vector embeddings
- Learn to work with multi-modal e-commerce data in Google Colab
- Learn how to integrate metadata into your vector search projects (and no we don't mean 'hybrid search')
- Sign up to Part 2 of this workshop, focused on bringing your vector-powered systems to production
  
By the end of this session, you will have a deeper understanding of how to apply vector search to a range of use-cases in e-commerce and to similar multi-modal data.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python and ability to follow along in a Google Colab.
- No external dependencies required (i.e. you don't need a local python environment or a vector database to get started).

## Agenda

1. **Get the data**  
   - Use a Google Colab notebook to analyse an e-commerce product dataset of text, images, numbers and categorical properties

2. **Let's start building**
   - Build a Similar Products feature that uses all the available product metadata
   - Build a simple Recommendation system that uses **user data & behavioral events**
   - Build a Search system 1.0 that uses the **image** and **description** data
   - Build a Search system 2.0 that takes into account **all product metadata**
   - Build a Search system 3.0 that adds per-user result **personalization**

4. **Part 2 Summary + Q&A**  
   - Get a sneak-peak at Superlinked Cloud CLI for running vector-powered systems reliably at scale
   - Ask your questions & connect with the speaker ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svonava/), [X](https://twitter.com/svonava)) - ðŸ‘‹ I mean it!

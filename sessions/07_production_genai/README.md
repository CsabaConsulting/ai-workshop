# Production-Ready GenAI Apps with Tracing & Evaluations

Welcome to the **Production-Ready GenAI Apps with Tracing & Evaluations** session of the DevFest AI Workshop! 

LLM demos are easy - making them reliable enough for production is hard. Weave (from Weights & Biases) helps with every stage of development and deployment, so you can iterate rapidly and build confidence in your application.

---

## Session Overview

**Instructor:** Sam Stowers

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Objective:**  
- Understand complex queries with tracing (3 lines of code!!)
- Rapidly identify cost & latency bottlenecks
- Implement evaluations to make LLM responses consistently good
- Test which LLMs are best for your needs
  
By the end of this session, you will have a deeper understanding of [specific concepts/skills].

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Familiarity with git, github, and the command line. You'll need to locally clone a repo.
- A Weights & Biases account (free)
- A Groq API key (free)

## Agenda

1. **Intro**  
   - [Brief description of the introduction phase, e.g., "Overview of human-in-the-loop concepts."]

2. **Sam briefly talks about evals**
   - Less than 5 mins about why tracing, why evals, how to use it, what we'll cover

3. **Challenge 1: Observability**

4. **Challenge 2: Evaluations**

5. **Challenge 3: The improvement flywheel**

6. **Q&A and Discussion**  
   - Open floor for questions on implementing evals in production systems.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Add observability for every LLM and major function in your application

### Challenge 2: Set up a programmatic eval & an LLM as a judge eval

### Challenge 3: Improve the app's prompts & performance using the new evals

### Step 1: Clone the Workshop Repository
If you haven't cloned the repository already, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamMakesThings/gdg-observability-workshop
cd gdg-observability-workshop
```

### Step 2: Complete the Hands-on Exercise
Follow the instructions in the Notion for each part of the exercise: https://wandbai.notion.site/GDG-Workshop-Instructions-Nov-9-24-138e2f5c7ef38078942beebe524ee171?pvs=4

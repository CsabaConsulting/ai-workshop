- **Title**: Make Your GenAI App Production-Ready with Tracing & Evaluations
- **Description**: LLM demos are easy - making them reliable enough for production is hard. Weave (from Weights & Biases) helps with every stage of development and deployment, so you can iterate rapidly and build confidence in your application.
  - Understand complex queries with tracing (3 lines of code!!)
  - Rapidly identify cost & latency bottlenecks
  - Implement evaluations to make LLM responses consistently good
  - Test which LLMs are best for your needs.
